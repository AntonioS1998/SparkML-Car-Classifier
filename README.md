# SparkML Car Classifier

This repository contains the code for a car classifier model using Apache Spark MLlib, implemented in a Google Colab Notebook. The aim of the project is to classify different car makes and models based on their features using machine learning algorithms available in the Spark MLlib library.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on Google Colab for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- A Google account with access to Google Drive and Google Colab

### Installation

1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/AntonioS1998/SparkML-Car-Classifier.git

2. Upload the project files to your Google Drive.

3. Open the `CarEvaluation.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.

## Usage

Follow the instructions in the `CarEvaluation.ipynb` notebook to train and evaluate the car classifier model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation). It consists of car features and their corresponding make and model labels.

## Model

The project utilizes machine learning algorithms from the Spark MLlib library, such as:

- Decision Trees
- Random Forests

## Evaluation

The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
